## What is Subtura?
Subtura is a **student-focused housing platform** designed to make subletting **safe, simple, and reliable**.

Think “Facebook Marketplace for sublets” — but built specifically for **university students**, with trust and clarity as the default.

---

## Mission
To help students find and offer sublets with confidence by building a trusted, student-only marketplace that reduces scams, stress, and uncertainty.

---

## Vision
A world where every student can secure housing for a term, co-op, or semester in minutes — with transparent listings, safer interactions, and a community that looks out for each other.

---

## The Problem
Student subletting is messy:
- Scams and sketchy listings are common
- Communication is fragmented and unreliable
- Students waste time sorting through low-quality or misleading posts
- It’s hard to know what’s real, what’s fair, and who to trust

---

## Our Approach
Subtura is built around a few core principles:
- **Student-only access**: a community designed for students, not random traffic
- **Trust first**: clear expectations, better listing quality, and safer communication
- **Term-friendly housing**: sublets that match how students actually move (semesters, co-ops, 4-month terms)
- **Simple UX**: fast browsing, easy posting, and straightforward conversations

---

## What You Can Do (Today)
Subtura is currently rolling out an early prototype to gather user feedback. Depending on what’s enabled during the rollout, you may be able to:
- Browse student sublet listings
- Filter by key details (e.g., term, price, location/distance)
- Sign up as a student to join the community
- Share feedback that directly shapes the product

---

## What’s Coming Next
As we move from prototype → production, we’re working toward features like:
- Stronger verification and trust signals
- Better reporting/moderation tools to reduce scams and spam
- Improved listing standards (required fields, clearer pricing, better photos)
- More guided workflows for both renters and listers (so fewer misunderstandings)
- A smoother end-to-end experience for term-based housing

*(Note: not all production features are available yet.)*

---

## Student Verification
Subtura is built for university students. Access is intended to be restricted to students so the marketplace stays relevant, safer, and higher quality.

---

## Current Status
🚧 **Prototype / early rollout**  
We’re actively collecting feedback and iterating quickly. Some features may be limited, incomplete, or subject to change.

If you’re using Subtura right now: thank you — your feedback directly influences what we build next.
